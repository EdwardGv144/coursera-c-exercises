# Sine of Validated Input

This program asks the user to input a number between `0` and `1`, validates that the input is within the expected range, and then computes its sine using the `sin()` function from `<math.h>`.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- `while` loop for input validation
- Logical conditions using `||`
- Floating-point input with `scanf`
- Computing sine of a value
- Displaying values with high precision using `printf`

## ðŸ›  How to Compile and Run

```bash
gcc sine_of_0_to_1.c -o sine_of_0_to_1
./sine_of_0_to_1.exe
