# Binary Tree Construction and Inorder Traversal

This program reads integers from a file, stores them in an array, and then inserts them into a **binary search tree**. It demonstrates how to:

- Read data from a file
- Dynamically allocate memory for arrays and tree nodes
- Insert elements into a **binary search tree (BST)**
- Perform **in-order traversal** of a BST
- Free allocated memory
